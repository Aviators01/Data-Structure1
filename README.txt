Description: This program takes user word inputs and stores them in a binary search tree and doubly-linked list.
After the input phase, it displays the words first in alphabetical order and then sorted by frequency (least-to-most
frequent). 

Limitation: Artificial limitation of 100 word inputs allowed.

Instructions: Navigate to the correct file folder.
	1. Compile and link by typing: make
	2. Run by typing: ./Words
		a. While program is running, type words (hit enter after each word) and then ctrl + d when finished
		   (to signify end of input).


Note: to use file input instead of keyboard. Type the following:
	./Words < TestData.txt		<--TestData.txt can be any filename along with its extension (.txt,.cpp, etc.)
